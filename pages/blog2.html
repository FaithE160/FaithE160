                    <h1 class="title post-title">Monday 20th Nov - Day One</h1>
                    <p class="post-excerpt">Today was my first day at Red Hat, doing their transition year programme. I arrived early at 9am and waited in the conference room for everyone else to arrive. Once all of the other students got here, James came in to explain to us the work the Red Hat does. He made it easy to comprehend as he explained it through the use of a roleplay. He started by asking us all to line up against the wall on one side of the room.He taught us how tech communities are formed by having just me move over to the wall on the other side of the room, pretending that I had just written the code for a QR code reader. James then told us to imagine that in this hypothetical situation I had made an error in the code without realising and that Isabella had noticed and offered to fix it for me. After that, Isabella moved over and joined me on the opposite wall. James kept going with this example, dragging in more and more students by giving them all individual roles on the same project. By the end, we realised we had all just formed an imaginary commnuity, helping our understanding of teammwork and communites in general. James informed us that once a community has developed a project, they sometimes hand that project over to a tech company such as Red Hat, who will then tweak it and market it towards their customers. I enjoyed this talk as I finally understood what exactly Red Hat does, when before taking part in this course, I wasn't fully sure what it does, only that it works with computers. James did icebreakers with us. Everyone got a famous fictional character or else a real-life celebrity stuckon their back but they weren't allowed to see who it was. We then had to go around the room asking people questions about the person on our backs to try to figure out who they were. I found this a great way to release the awkwardness and tension between people. It helped me get talking to people I hadn't previously spoken to and the game itself was fun. My celebrity was Harry Styles! We were then given a tour of the Red Hat offices and I was amazed and impressed by the facilites Red Hat has, all of it is so modern (which makes sense for a tech company) but I wasn't expecting to turn the corner and see a treadmill amidst the office desks. We were all assigned our own desks with laptops, making the programme feel very professional. We sat and had lunch then, some people played with the Nintendo Switch on a big TV screen in the canteen, whilst others made their way over to the pool table. Once again, I thought that Red Hat seems like a lovely environment to work in, as it's all tailored towards employee wellbeing in my opinion. Unfortunately, I had to leave early today, as I had to attend a school debating competition in Dublin but I really enjoyed spending the morning here and was sorry to miss out on the GIT Workshop tomorrow. Since the PowerPoint she was working off of though was posted to Slack, I have hope that I'll be able to catch up to the others in no time (if I can work the coding out!)

                  <h1 class="title post-title">Tuesday 21st Nov - Day Two</h1>
                  <p class="post-excerpt">Today was my second day at Red Hat and I was eager to start learning more about coding and computers in general. We had some time to work on our blogs first thing in the morning, which I used to polish up yesterday's blog. I appreciate the fact we were allocated time during the day to work on our blogs as it alleviates pressure to rush to complete them and ensures we have no homework to do for this programme! I love being treated as an adult in a work environment like we all are here, it's a freeing experience and it feels more like authentic work experience since we are in many ways responsible for managing our own time.The first talk today was with Fortune Ndlovu in the conference room, where he talked to us about "Agile" which is essentially a mindset to make people awesome. I learnt a lot from it, including the "scrum" tactic, a technique named after a scrum in rugby. Fortune taught us that having an organised step-by-step guide for doing tasks was important before diving into them, so we exercised this concept together. We divided into teams to create the best Mr. Potato Head monstrosity that we could, but first we had to write the instructions for completing the task on sticky notes and have a proper system for doing the tasks. I soon learnt that my team wasn't very good at following these directions as we were all over the place doing the task but eventually we ended up with a rather villainous, if slightly goofy, Mr. Potato Head. After lunch, Dominik showed us how to programme simple things on Microbit, once we had established what a microbit actually is. The programme we used reminded me a bit of scratch and I found it was relatively easy to code using blocks, but I definitely found using python more difficult. I ended up programming a simple "Rock, paper, scissors" game on the website with the help of a tutorial. I worked on my blog a bit more until 5pm and then went home happy.   </p>

                  <h1 class="title post-title">Wednesday 22nd Nov - Day Three</h1>
                  <p class="post-excerpt">I walked in this morning and went straight to my desk to work on my blog from Tuesday. At around 10:30, we made our way over to the conference room for a mysterious engineering challenge. We were tasked with making a rollercoaster (WITH A LOOP!!!) for a bouncy ball out of onlyÂ  paper, tinfoil, plastic straws, and the boxes those items came in. I was on a team with Syasya and Oscar. We first had to plan out our rollercoasters, after all, we'd just learnt the importance of planning the day before with the catastrophic Mr. Potato Heads. You'd think we would've learned our lesson by now about not jumping headfirst into assignments, but judging from some questionable decisions along the way - I guess not! My team didn't spend long planning before we started messing around with the straws, trying to make a prototype of sorts, because we'd just seen one of the other teams start constructing despite not being allowed to. Karma came back to bite us though when the only team not to do this ended up winning by a landslide. The importance of proper planning was reinforced in us from this experience and we realised that in the future, maybe planning should be more than just a dodgy diagram. We had to stop building for a while when we received a talk on AI. We learnt that software developers are currently in the process of programming artificial intelligences to be able to predict flooding in an area before it happens! I found this talk particularly interesting as I was familiar with some forms of AI already, such as ChatGPT and the Snapchat AI. Cathal talked to us about the path he took after leaving school to get to the high position in Red Hat that he's in today and it was very inspirational. Then a college student attending SETU Waterford named Daniel Lawton talked to us about the degree in computer science that he's doing at the moment. Daniel encouraged us to go to SETU if we felt that was right for us, as some fellow studentsÂ  had reservations about staying in Waterford to go to college and he also reassured us that it was perfectly okay if we didn't know exactly what we want to do as a career yet. This put my mind to ease as I have no clue what occupation I want to pursue yet, despite this course being highly engaging and interesting. After that talk, we went back to building the rollercoasters and one group finished theirs rapidly, with it being able to fully function. Everyone was impressed at their innovative design, which is when my team started to regret making walls out of flimsy tinfoil and using a short tinfoil box as our only support. The two remaining teams struggled long and hard to get their coasters to work but time was ticking. Eventually, we all decided we only had one reasonable option left - plagiarism. Jennifer rebranded the plagiarism though as having a licence to use the other team's work and tweaks were made to their design in the end anyway. Thankfully by 4:30pm, all three roller coasters worked properly and we showed them off to the staff in the office. I loved doing the challenge, it helped develop my collaboration skills as I was part of a team and I had a lot of fun despite failing many times. This has been my favourite day so far, as I enjoyed both the AI talk and the challenge immensely. It's around 5pm now, so it's time to go home!</p>
